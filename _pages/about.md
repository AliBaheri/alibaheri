I am an assistant professor of research in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.statler.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/) where I direct the **Safe AI Lab**. At our lab, we conduct research at the intersection of autonomy, controls, and machine learning.
Our vision is to make progress toward **safe**, **certified**, and **efficient** autonomy with the application to intelligent systems on the ground or in the air. To achieve that goal, we leverage tools from artificial intelligence, data-driven optimization techniques, and control theory. Our work has been generously funded by **[NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2132060)**, **[FAA](https://media.statler.wvu.edu/news/2021/09/09/wvu-engineer-earns-federal-award-for-safety-validation-of-ai-based-avionic-systems)**, and **[NASA](https://media.statler.wvu.edu/news/2022/01/24/wvu-engineers-address-nasa-problems-through-artificial-intelligence)**.

Prior to joining WVU, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the [University of Michigan-Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I received my Ph.D. at the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/) in 2018.

**I will be joining the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.rit.edu/engineering/department-mechanical-engineering) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in Spring 2023! If you are interested in joining the Safe AI Lab, send me an email. Before that, I will join the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)](http://sisl.stanford.edu/) as a visiting scholar.**
