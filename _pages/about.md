I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.rit.edu/engineering/department-mechanical-engineering) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) where I direct the **Safe AI Lab**. Our lab focuses on research at the intersection of autonomy, controls, and machine learning. Before joining RIT, I was a visiting scholar at [Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)](http://sisl.stanford.edu/). Prior to that, I was an assistant professor (in the research track) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the [University of Michiganâ€”Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I received my Ph.D. at the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/) in 2018.


Our vision is to make progress toward **safe**, **certified**, and **efficient** autonomy with the application of intelligent systems on the ground or in the air. To achieve that goal, we leverage tools from artificial intelligence, data-driven optimization techniques, and control theory. Our work has been generously funded by **[NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2132060)**, **[FAA](https://media.statler.wvu.edu/news/2021/09/09/wvu-engineer-earns-federal-award-for-safety-validation-of-ai-based-avionic-systems)**, and **[NASA](https://media.statler.wvu.edu/news/2022/01/24/wvu-engineers-address-nasa-problems-through-artificial-intelligence)**.
